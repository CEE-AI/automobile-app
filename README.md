# ClientSide

This project was written in JavaScript in Angular framework using Bootstrap library for responsiveness and UI design

## Why JavaScript and Angular Framework?

JavaScript is a well developed and dynamic programming language that is supported by many browsers and it is very efficient for client-side development and is compatible with most CSS framework and HTML variants.

Angular is an opinionated and robust framework that is broken down into organized components and routers that allows for reusable codes, scalability and easy managing of HTML, CSS, Typescript and testing.
I used angular because of its typescript syntax that allowed for less coding errors, Dependency Injection that made it easy to manage dependencies in modules and components. Two-way data binding which allows automatic synchronization of data between the model and the view, reducing the need for manual DOM manipulation.
